# BNE_urbanJungles
Urban Jungles' app is an open source, crowd-sourced, public, data driven app to allow users' who are neurodiverse to monitor their surroundings in an attempt to avoid or cope with areas that negatively affect their senses.

## Problem
There are seven senses which can affect a person who is neurodiverse. For some, these senses can affect them to the point they are unable to perform some of the basic activities in life. Those senses are: sight, smell, touch, taste, noise, spatial and balance. 

## Existing Solutions
There are no existing solutions provided in real time to allow a neurodiverse user to plan a journey or assist them whilst on their journey. There is some public data to establish a reference point for new users.

## Goals
Develop an app to address three tasks:
* Provide a Journey Planner taking into account, the neurodiverse user's level of sensitivity to the seven senses;
* Allow users to switch from a journey map to a terrain viewer to help with spatial & depth perception challenges.
